<p>
Welcome to <em>@@@product@@@</em>
</p>

<p>
Use this menu to select the desired function. If you have
problems navigating in this help system, press
<em>@@@fkey_help@@@</em> to enter the <a href="#help">description</a> of the help
system. The main functions in this menu are:
</p>

<p>
<a href="#start">Start Live System</a>: Select this option 
to start using the @@@product@@@ Live Media.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#nonfree">Start (non-free drivers)</a>: Select this option 
to start using the @@@product@@@ Live Media including non-free drivers.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#harddisk">Boot from Hard Disk</a>: This selection does not
affect the installed system. It only starts a previously installed
operating system.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#hdt">Hardware Detection Tool</a>: This selection will launch
a tool for checking your hardware. This tool does not affect
or determine the hardware used for installing <em>@@@product@@@</em>. 
</p>

<p>
<a href="#noacpi">ACPI Disabled</a>: Many of the
currently-sold computers have incomplete or faulty ACPI
implementations. This selection disables ACPI support in the
kernel, but still enables many performance features, like DMA for IDE
hard disks.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#nolapic">Local APIC Disabled</a>:
If the normal installation fails, this might be due to the
system hardware not supporting local APIC.
If this seems to be the case, use this option to
install without local APIC support.
</p>
<p>
<a href="#memtest">Memory Test</a>: Memory testing is useful for more than
checking installation of new memory modules. It is a stress test
for a big part of your computer system and may indicate hardware
problems.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#opt">Boot Options</a>: The boot options may change the
behavior of your system completely. They are settings for
the kernel.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#help">@@@fkey_help@@@ Help</a>: This is context sensitive. It will
show different screens depending on the active element of the
boot screen. There is also a description of this help system
available.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#keytable">@@@fkey_lang@@@</a>: Set language and keyboard mapping
used by the boot loader.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#videomode">@@@fkey_video@@@ Video Mode</a>: Here, choose between
different screen resolutions while installing. If you encounter
problems with the graphical installation, the <em>text mode</em> may
be a work-around for you.
