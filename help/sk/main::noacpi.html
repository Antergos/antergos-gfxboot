<a name="noacpi">Inštalácia - bez ACPI</a>
</h3>

<p>
Current hardware usually requires ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface)
to control the interrupt handling.
ACPI completely replaces the old APM system.
</p>

<p>
Select <em>Inštalácia - bez ACPI</em> if you encounter
problems during boot of the kernel. Known problems with machines that
have problems with ACPI are:
<ul>
  <li>kernel freezes when booting</li>
  <li>PCI Cards are not detected or initialized properly</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
You may also try the <a href="#firmware">Test firmvéru</a> boot option
and look at the test results of the ACPI validation.
